# Surrealism API v1
This is the guest API for the Surrealism runtime.
It's designed to be abstract and compatible with any language.

## Common types
When these types are used, they are a u32 representing the starting pointer of the data in the guest memory.
Each type here is fixed length, and each segment is listed

- `Buf<T>` (8 bytes)
  - `T` is the type of the data, usually in flatbuffers format
  - 4: `u32` - pointer to the start of the data
  - 4: `u32` - length of the data

## Imports
- Utilities:
  - `__sr_sql` (sql: Buf<String>, vars: Buf<Object>) -> Buf<Value>
  - `__sr_run` (name: Buf<String>, version: Buf<Option<String>>, vars: Buf<Object>) -> Buf<Value>

- KV:
  - `__sr_set` (name: Buf<String>, value: Buf<Value>) -> Buf<Value>
  - `__sr_get` (name: Buf<String>) -> Buf<Value>
  - `__sr_del` (name: Buf<String>) -> Buf<Value>
  - `__sr_list` (prefix: Buf<String>) -> Buf<Value>
  - `__sr_exists` (name: Buf<String>) -> Buf<Value>

Exports:
- `__sr_alloc` (size: u32, align: u32) -> u32
- `__sr_free` (ptr: u32, size: u32)
